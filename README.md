### 💡 My Business Journey

My goal is to transition from a service-based business to a product-based one. I'm currently using my freelance work as a strategic **R&D phase** to validate and fund my first micro-SaaS product.

As I work with clients in the web development space, I'm identifying recurring, unsolved problems. The goal is to build a simple, elegant software solution that scales, giving me the freedom to create more impactful products.
