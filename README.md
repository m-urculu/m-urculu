I'm a full-stack developer obsessed with creating beautiful, functional digital experiences. I believe good design isn't just about looks—it's about making things intuitive and delightful to use.

### 💡 My Journey

Right now, I'm building a freelance business to fund and inform my next big idea. I'm using every client project as a chance to identify a real-world problem—the kind of problem that's ripe for a software solution.

The ultimate goal is to build a product that solves a real need, so I can scale beyond trading time for money and focus on creating things that have a truly lasting impact.
